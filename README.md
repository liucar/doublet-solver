# doublet-solver
A program that solves doublet puzzles of length 5 using a Graph and DoubletSolver class.

## Notes:

- Doublets solver works only for words of length 5

- Graph class adapted from graph.h

- Dictionary created from knuth.txt

- No path will output “None”

- The graph is an adjacency list. Egdes connect 2 words differing
	   at exactly one position (4 characters in common).
